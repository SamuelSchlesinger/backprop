Applications
============

Congratulations!  You are now a *backprop* master.  Now what?

*   Check out my [Introducing the backprop library][intro] blog post where I
    announced the library to the world.  In it, I introduce the library by
    building and training a full artificial neural network with it, and use it
    to classify the famous MNIST handwritten digit data set.

*   If you want an even more high-level perspective and inspiration, check out
    my [A Purely Functional Typed Approach to Trainable Models][models] blog
    series, where I talk about how looking at modeling through the lens of
    differentiable programming with purely functional typed code can provide
    new insights and help you develop and train effective models.
